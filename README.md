### Texera's website

To set up the website locally:

1. make sure you have `NodeJS` and `npm` installed
2. run `npm install` to build the project
3. run `npm start` to start the blog server
4. go to `localhost:1313`
5. all the changes to the markdown file will be directly reflected on the website

The website [texera.github.io](texera.github.io) will be automatically synced with any changes to the `main` branch.
