The previous implementation of the code editor in the operator can only display the code as plain text (as shown in Figure 1), and it lacks many IDE-like features such as syntax checking and autocomplete. These limitations hinder the productivity of UDF developers. For instance, users often made syntax mistakes that were discovered only when they tried to execute the code.</description></item><item><title>Using Texera to Perform Single-cell RNA Sequencing Analysis with R Language</title><link>/blog/using-texera-to-perform-single-cell-rna-sequencing-analysis-with-r-language/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 14:26:21 -0700</pubDate><guid>/blog/using-texera-to-perform-single-cell-rna-sequencing-analysis-with-r-language/</guid><description>RNA sequence analysis has revolutionized our understanding of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and dynamics. Seurat, a popular R library, has emerged as a versatile toolkit for the comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
While the core engine of Texera is built using Scala, it supports the integration of Python UDFs, allowing users to incorporate custom Python code directly into their data processing pipelines.</description></item></channel></rss>
