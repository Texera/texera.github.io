Many machine learning (ML) platforms have fostered communities that contribute a wealth of workflow templates and examples. These resources are invaluable for learning, research, and practical application. To make them accessible to Texera users, we have developed a workflow converter so that users can easily parse and translate third-party workflows to Texera&amp;rsquo;s workflows. The translated workflows can also expand Texera&amp;rsquo;s workflow repository, which can facilitate the process of building a community for Texera and developing AI-based workflow recommendation algorithms.</description></item><item><title>How We Built a Real-time Collaborative Workflow Editor in Texera</title><link>/blog/how-we-built-a-real-time-collaborative-workflow-editor-in-texera/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:27:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/how-we-built-a-real-time-collaborative-workflow-editor-in-texera/</guid><description>Real-time collaborative editing has been so popularized in recent years to the point that it has become almost a hidden standard for major document editing providers. Google Docs Editors, which includes Google Docs, Google Slides, etc., was a pioneer in real-time collaborative editing. Microsoft Office did not have real-time co-authoring capability until 2013, 7 years after the initial release of Google Docs Editors. Then came Overleaf, which has become the go-to place for co-editing LaTeX documents.</description></item></channel></rss>
