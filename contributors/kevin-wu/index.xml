Its popularity is driven by its capabilities and the growing demand for data-related work. Given its significance, our goal was to allow users to seamlessly integrate R into Texera workflows.
We want to enhance Texera by extending its support to include R code and facilitating the creation of R user-defined functions (UDFs) for both the table and tuple APIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
