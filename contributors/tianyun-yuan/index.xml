Many machine learning (ML) platforms have fostered communities that contribute a wealth of workflow templates and examples. These resources are invaluable for learning, research, and practical application. To make them accessible to Texera users, we have developed a workflow converter so that users can easily parse and translate third-party workflows to Texera&amp;rsquo;s workflows. The translated workflows can also expand Texera&amp;rsquo;s workflow repository, which can facilitate the process of building a community for Texera and developing AI-based workflow recommendation algorithms.</description></item></channel></rss>
