Texera offers a workflow operator called “Python UDF,” which enables users to specify any desired operator behavior that best suits their needs. It is a powerful tool that offers users high levels of control over their workflows. While this operator enables Texera to provide the same data processing capabilities as the Alteryx platform, it comes with the drawback of requiring users to code.</description></item></channel></rss>
