The previous implementation of the code editor in the operator can only display the code as plain text (as shown in Figure 1), and it lacks many IDE-like features such as syntax checking and autocomplete. These limitations hinder the productivity of UDF developers. For instance, users often made syntax mistakes that were discovered only when they tried to execute the code.</description></item></channel></rss>
